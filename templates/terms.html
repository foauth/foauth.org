						<p>We hate complicated terms of service too, so let's keep this simple, shall we? If anything seems out of place, you don't have to sign up, but please tell us what you don't like, because we want to know if you think we're doing something sleazy.</p>

						<h2>What we hope you'll do</h2>
						<p>These aren't part of the official terms of service, so you don't have to agree to do anything on this final list. But we're working hard to bring you a service you'll enjoy, and it'd be awesome if you like it so much that you'd want to do something more.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Tell your friends how much you love foauth.org and encourage them to sign up as well.</li>
							<li>Share what you've built on foauth.org, so we and your fellow users can learn from what you've done.</li>
							<li>Suggest new services for use with foauth.org. We can't possibly find them all, so feel free to submit your own.</li>
							<li>Contribute to foauth.org itself. The <a href="https://github.com/foauth/foauth.org">source code</a> is freely available, and even if you can't help with the code, we're open to suggestions.</li>
